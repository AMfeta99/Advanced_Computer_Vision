# Advanced Computer Vision

This repository is dedicated to projects and some theoretical material that I used to get into topics of Computer Vision (CV) in a practical/efficient way.

## Some of the topics covered:
- Image Classification
- Object Detection/Location
- Image Segmentation
- Vizualization and Interpretability
