This app is based on Vision Transformer (ViT) model [google/vit-base-patch16-224](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224) that was fine-tuned for binary classification of brain X-rays, using the dataset [brain-tumor-dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-100/brain-tumor-m2pbp) that contains 253 brain images. This dataset was originally created by Yousef Ghanem.
