# Advanced Computer Vision

This repository is dedicated to projects and some theoretical material that I used to get into topics of Computer Vision (CV) in a practical/efficient way.

## Some of the topics covered:
- Image Classification
- Object Detection/Location
- Image Segmentation
- Vizualization and Interpretability



## Courses:
### [AI for Medical Diagnosis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-medical-diagnosis) (DeepLearning.AI)
AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments.
But how can AI be applied to medical imaging to diagnose diseases? 

This course offered:
  - Nuances of working with both 2D and 3D medical image data, for multi-class classification and image segmentation.
  - Practical/theorical material of how to classify diseases in x-ray images and segment tumors in 3D MRI brain images.
  - How to properly evaluate the performance of your models.


### [Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-computer-vision-with-tensorflow/) (DeepLearning.AI & TensorFlow)
  - Explore image classification, image segmentation, object localization, and object detection. Apply transfer learning to object localization and detection.
  - Object detection models such as regional-CNN and ResNet-50, customize existing models, and build your own models to detect, localize, and label images.
  - Implement image segmentation using variations of the fully convolutional network (FCN) including U-Net and Mask-RCNN to identify and detect numbers, pets, zombies, and more.
  - Identify which parts of an image are being used by your model to make its predictions using class activation maps and saliency maps and apply these ML interpretation methods to inspect and improve the design of a famous network, AlexNet.
