# [Computer Vision Course (by Hugging Face)](https://huggingface.co/learn/computer-vision-course/unit0/welcome/welcome)
(ongoing... repository under construction)


The repository contains:

## Short Project:
After researching and understanding the SOTA models for the several Computer vision tasks. I run a project to practice and gain some skills. There I fine-tune a transformer with a dataset from huggingface hub, and documented it properly in build an app that is hosted it on Hugging Face Spaces, so anyone can have access to it. 

Check it out at:
- [Brain Tumor Diagnosis App](https://github.com/AMfeta99/Advanced_Computer_Vision/tree/main/Computer_Vision_HF/brain_tumor_diagnosis_app_HF) : Brain tumor diagnostic app developed with Gradio. ViT fine-tuned for binary classification of brain X-rays.
